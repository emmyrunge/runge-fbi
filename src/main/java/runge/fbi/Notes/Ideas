create an FBI "service"
filters through every POI
displays picture, name, basic info on person, crime and last seen location

--maybe add n/n to see how far down the array i am

filter through pictures on tap
(should i have two buttons so i can go back and forward)

put info into a list if it is not already and then just go down or up the list that way
---will use a button for this feature
------maybe make button pretty/interesting?
----------have fun with design aspects

--potentially add in feature to look up a POI via a search feature???


TESTS:
if service works
if it displays new image after every click



??? is there a rubric for the project? will ask on zoom meeting --no
??? need to ask if dagger should be used for my project -- yes



FIRST:
setting up fbi to work with service (use earthquake as guide)

SECOND:
adapt to how we do things now (use weather as guide)
